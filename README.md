# Energy Sim Project
<br>

Hi, thanks for visiting!

This project is being developed to support dissertation research in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at the University of Delaware.

The _GitHub repository_ (#TODO: hyperlink) underlying this site is intended to eventually contain additional project resources -- such as simulation platform builds; input, modeling, and experiment data for publications; and resources to facilitate community-engaged platform use via visual modeling tools for GAMA.
