# Energy Sim Project
<br>

Hi, thanks for visiting!

This project is being developed to support dissertation research in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at the University of Delaware.

The <a href="https://github.com/udbtsteve/energy-sim-project/">GitHub repository</a> underlying the project site is intended to contain additional project resources as they're developed -- such as:
- Simulation platform builds
- Input, modeling, and experiment data for publications
- Resources to facilitate community-engaged energy planning and simulation platform use via visual code development tools (which integrate with <a href="https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Home">GAMA</a>, the intended agent-oriented modeling/simulation/visualization language for the project)
