# Energy Sim Project
<br>

Hi, thanks for visiting!

This project is being developed to support dissertation research in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at the University of Delaware.

The _GitHub repository_ (#TODO: hyperlink) underlying this site will eventually contain additional project resources -- including simulation platform builds; data, modeling, and experiment information for project publications; and resources to facilitate community-engaged platform use via GAMA visual modeling tools.
